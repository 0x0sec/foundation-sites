# [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com)

This is the supremely in-development version of Foundation for Sites 6.0.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites-6.git
cd foundation-sites-6
npm install
```

Run `gulp css` to compile the Sass into CSS. Open `foundation.scss` and look at the imports list to see which components are in place.

Run `gem install hologram` and then `gulp docs` to compile the documentation. It's written to the `build` folder.
