title: Breakpoints
name: breakpoints

The string interpolation method of creating breakpoints in Foundation 5 has been replaced with a new `breakpoint()` mixin.

```scss
.element {
  font-size: 1.5rem;

  @include breakpoint(medium) {
    font-size: 2rem;
  }
}
```

/// @group breakpoints
////

/// A list of named breakpoints. You can use these with the `breakpoint()` mixin to quickly create media queries.
/// @type Map
$breakpoints: (
  small: rem-calc(0),
  medium: rem-calc(640),
  large: rem-calc(1200),
  xlarge: rem-calc(1440),
  xxlarge: rem-calc(1920),
) !default;

/// All of the names in this list will be output as classes in your CSS, like small-12, medium-6, and so on. Each value in this list must also be in the `$breakpoints` map.
/// @type List
$breakpoint-classes: (small medium large) !default;

/// Wraps a media query around the content you put inside the mixin. This mixin accepts a number of values:
///  - If a string is passed, the mixin will look for it in the $breakpoints map, and use a media query there.
///  - If a pixel value is passed, it will be converted to an em value using $rem-base.
///  - If a rem value is passed, the unit will be changed to em.
///  - If an em value is passed, the value will be used as-is.
/// @param {Keyword|Number} $val - Breakpoint name or px/em/rem value to process.
/// @output If the breakpoint is "0px and larger", outputs the content. Otherwise, outputs the content wrapped in a media query.
