<p class="deck">Create powerful multi-device layouts quickly and easily with the default 12-column, nest-able Foundation grid. If you're familiar with grid systems, you'll feel right at home. If not, you'll learn quickly.</p>

---

Start by adding an element with a class of `row`. This will create a horizontal block to contain vertical columns. Then add elements with a `column` class within that row. You can use `column` or `columns`â€”the only difference is grammar. Specify the widths of each column with the `small-#`, `medium-#`, and `large-#` classes.

**Foundation is mobile-first.** Code for small screens first, and larger devices will inherit those styles. Customize for larger screens as necessary.
